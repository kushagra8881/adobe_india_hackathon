# After installing the above, download the spaCy models:
# python -m spacy download xx_ent_wiki_sm
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
# (You may need to download other language models as needed if you expect non-English documents frequently)
# No longer strictly needed for this version (removed ML components)
# Manual SpaCy Model Download for Offline Use:
# VERY IMPORTANT: Before running the application in an offline environment,
# you MUST manually download the required spaCy model(s).
# For this version, 'xx_ent_wiki_sm' is the recommended universal model:
# python -m spacy download xx_ent_wiki_sm
# If you decide to include 'en_core_web_sm' for slightly better English summarization (and accept higher model size):
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
