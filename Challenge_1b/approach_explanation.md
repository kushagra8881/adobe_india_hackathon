# Document Intelligence System Approach

## Overview

Our document intelligence system extracts and prioritizes the most relevant sections from multiple documents based on a specific persona and their job-to-be-done. The system follows a pipeline architecture to process documents efficiently while meeting the CPU-only and time constraints.

## Methodology

### 1. Document Processing & Text Extraction
- Documents are parsed using PyMuPDF (fitz) to extract text, structural elements, and metadata
- We preserve document hierarchy by identifying sections, subsections, and content blocks
- Images are processed using OCR (Tesseract) when text extraction alone is insufficient

### 2. Persona-Job Analysis
- The system creates an embedding representation of the persona and job description
- This embedding serves as a semantic anchor to measure relevance of document sections
- We use a lightweight sentence transformer model (<1GB) to generate these embeddings

### 3. Relevance Ranking Algorithm
- Each document section is embedded using the same model
- Semantic similarity between section embeddings and persona-job embeddings is calculated
- We apply a multi-factor scoring function that considers:
  - Semantic similarity score
  - Section importance (based on document structure)
  - Content density and information richness
  - Cross-document relevance patterns

### 4. Subsection Extraction & Refinement
- Once top sections are identified, we perform granular analysis on subsections
- Text is refined through extractive summarization to maintain context while improving readability
- We apply coreference resolution to ensure extracted snippets are self-contained

### 5. Output Generation
- Results are formatted into the required JSON structure
- Sections are ranked by importance score
- Processing timestamp and metadata are included

## Optimization Techniques

To meet the execution constraints:
- We use batch processing for document embedding
- Apply selective parsing to focus on high-potential document regions
- Implement a progressive refinement approach that improves accuracy within time limits
- Use quantized models for efficient CPU processing

The system balances precision and performance by focusing computational resources on the most promising content sections first, ensuring relevant information is captured within the 60-second execution window.
