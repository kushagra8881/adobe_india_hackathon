go though the readme once before decision. it contains the code file needs and the answers for whys??!

i have used spacy for multilingual support 

i have used a weight-based heuristic approach with dynamic decisions(for file to file adaptability) for decison making insted of a ML based approach since there is no specific dataset and it would be foolish to base the entire challenge on a synthetic based data.
